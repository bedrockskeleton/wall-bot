# What is Raspberry Pi
The Raspberry Pi is a small, low-cost computer about the size of a credit card. It was created by the Raspberry Pi Foundation to help people, especially students, learn about computers and programming. Even though it’s tiny and affordable, it can do many things a regular computer can do, like browsing the internet, watching videos, playing games, and writing documents. It has a processor, memory (RAM), USB ports for keyboard and mouse, an HDMI port for connecting to a screen, and uses a microSD card for storage. People use Raspberry Pi for fun and creative projects like building robots, making smart home systems, setting up weather stations, or creating retro video game consoles. It supports simple programming languages like Python and Scratch, making it great for beginners. Because it’s cheap, easy to use, and very versatile, Raspberry Pi is popular among students, teachers, and tech hobbyists around the world.

# How Is Raspberry Pi Composed 
The Raspberry Pi is made up of many small parts that are all placed on a tiny green board. These parts work together to make it a working computer. The most important part is the processor, which is like the brain. It does all the thinking and runs the programs. It also has RAM, which is memory that helps it work faster and do more things at once.

The Raspberry Pi has USB ports where you can plug in a mouse, keyboard, or USB stick. It has an HDMI port, which lets you connect it to a monitor or TV so you can see what you're doing. Instead of a big hard drive, it uses a microSD card. This card holds the operating system and all your files, like pictures or documents.

It also has a power port where you plug in a charger to give it electricity. Most models have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth built in, so you can connect to the internet or other devices without wires. There is also a special row of metal pins called GPIO pins. These pins let you connect things like lights, buttons, and sensors, so you can build cool projects.

All these parts are put together on the board in a factory using special machines. Even though the Raspberry Pi is very small, it has everything you need to use it like a computer or to build fun and creative projects.
