# What is Raspberry Pi
The Raspberry Pi is a small, low-cost computer about the size of a credit card. It was created by the Raspberry Pi Foundation to help people, especially students, learn about computers and programming. Even though it’s tiny and affordable, it can do many things a regular computer can do, like browsing the internet, watching videos, playing games, and writing documents. It has a processor, memory (RAM), USB ports for keyboard and mouse, an HDMI port for connecting to a screen, and uses a microSD card for storage. People use Raspberry Pi for fun and creative projects like building robots, making smart home systems, setting up weather stations, or creating retro video game consoles. It supports simple programming languages like Python and Scratch, making it great for beginners. Because it’s cheap, easy to use, and very versatile, Raspberry Pi is popular among students, teachers, and tech hobbyists around the world.
